Home Assistant

I have been using Home Assistant for awhile now. I had to restart from scratch a couple times early on but setting up a automated backup has made my life a lot easier.

Just wanting to share my config files in case it helps anyone. I haven't setup many automations. I need ot get into those but with school, two jobs and life, I stay busy.

Many plans for the future. I have the parts for another multisensor (BruhAutomation), a thermostat (DrZzs), a few Sonoff's just laying around as well. Just need to get going on it all.
